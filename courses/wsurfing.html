        <h1>Windsurfing</h1>
        <p><em>The versatility of windsurfing makes it an awesome watersport to learn, and at the Rip Curl School of
            Surf
            you can learn everything you need to know to get started. Our courses are centred around getting you out on
            the
            water and practicing as much as possible, and your coach will select the best board and sail for your
            height, weight
            and ability. You’ll learn the best technique for progressing quickly, and have chance to use the best
            professional
            standard equipment as your skills improve.</em></p>
        
        <h2>Level 1 – Sail Control</h2>
        
        <p>Learn the basics about windsurfing equipment and how to handle a windsurfing sail before moving into the
            water
            and putting the theory into practice. Your coach will demonstrate launching from the beach, how to balance
            the sail,
            how to get moving and how to recover if you fall from the board. Once you’re balancing your weight against
            the
            sail’s weight correctly, you’ll then practice windsurfing up and down wind, turning the board and learn how
            to control
            your speed.</p><br/>
        
        <h2>Level 2 – Board Control</h2>
        
        <p>With your sail control honed, you can move on to improving your board control and learning more advanced
            windsurfing techniques. We’ll start with some theory on how to use wind patterns to your advantage and then
            hook you up to a
            harness so you’re attached to your sail. Out on the water your coach will shadow you, showing you how to
            start
            up in deepwater, the best foot placement for manoeuvrability and how to quickly pick up speed.</p><br/>
        
        <h2>Level 3 – Advance Techniques</h2>
        
        <p>With the basics already mastered, you’ll be using a pro model board with foot straps on this course. Your
            coach
            will teach you racing techniques like fast rail turns and carving, and you’ll practice planing at high
            speeds. You’ll
            have a chance to practice jumps, and your coach will provide you with advice on how you can improve your
            technique to push your skills even further.</p><br/>
        
        <h2>Wind Surfing private – One-on-one</h2>
        
        <p>Learn or improve your windsurfing skills faster with a one-on-one session with one of our coaches. No matter
            what
            your skill level is, your coach will assess your ability, hook you up with the best board and sail and run
            you
            through what areas you need to work on. If you want to improve a particular skill, like sail control or
            planing,
            just tell your coach and the session can be tailored to whatever you need.</p><br/>
