		<h1>Team</h1>
		
		<p>Together, our professionally trained employees offer over 150 years of surfing experience to provide the
			highest-level,
			professional surf training. We comb through hundreds of applications every year and hand select only the
			best to
			join
			our team. All employees must go through our comprehensive in-house certification program before they are
			granted the
			responsibility of student instruction. Our team consists of professionally trained educators with 1000+
			teaching
			hours
			to all types for students of all levels.<br>-
		</p>
		
		<p>This is no ordinary staff. We only employ the highest quality individuals with overlapping and complementary
			qualifications. Together, our staff possesses deep knowledge and an impressive base of experience, including
			an
			Ocean
			Safety Director, an EMT, and a Wilderness First Responder. All Rozy Surf Camp instructors are American Red
			Cross
			Lifeguard, CPR, Water Safety, and First Aid Certified. Most importantly we also have a burning desire to
			better
			ourselves in every aspect of our programs. We utilize consultation and training from Ocean Safety experts
			outside
			our
			organization for continuing education. We value and incorporate feedback from students, staff, and parents
			as we
			continually evaluate and better our policies and instruction-methodologies.<br>-
		</p>
		
		<p>All our quality control policies and procedures take valuable resources to implement and carry out. At the
			end of
			every
			day, your utmost safety and quality experience mean everything to us. We want you to have an unforgettable
			adventure
			that will change your life forever!
